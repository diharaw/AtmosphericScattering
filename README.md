# Bruneton Sky Model
A compute shader based implementation of Eric Brunetons' recently updated Atmospheric Scattering implementation with a practical rasterization-based demo instead of the ray-tracing demo provided with Erics' own repository.

The compute shader implementation of the precomputation step is a direct OpenGL and GLSL port of the [Unity implementation](https://github.com/Scrawk/Brunetons-Improved-Atmospheric-Scattering) by Scrawk.

## Demo
Please check the Releases section for the demo binary along with the assets. Just extract it and run the executable!
